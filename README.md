# Contextual Chatbot in PyTorch

I build a simple chatbot using PyTorch and Deep Learning, with basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

1) Theory + NLP concepts (Stemming, Tokenization, bag of words)
2) Create training data
3) PyTorch model and training
4) Save/load model and implement the chat
5) The implementation is straightforward with a Feed-Forward Neural net with 2 hidden layers.
6) Customization for your own use case is super easy. Just modify intents.json with possible patterns and responses and re-run the training with some changes in hidden layers.
